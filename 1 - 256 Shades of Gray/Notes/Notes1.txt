Building a Program to Automatically Recognize Images of Numbers
===============================================================

MACHINE LEARNING:

Writing programs that learn how to perform a task from experience,
without being explicitly programmed to do so.

LEARNING:

A program is learning if, as it is given more data points,
it becomes automatically better at performing a given task.

The program should be able to learn from experience
	-> pre-existing dataset of past observations
	-> data accumulated by the program itself as it performs its job (Online Learning)

FEATURE EXTRACTION:

A significant part of machine learning revolves around gathering and
preparing data to be in a form your program will be able to use.

MEASURE:

Your program needs to be able to understand how well it is performing its task,
so that it can adjust and learn from experience.
Thus, it is crucial to define a measure that properly captures what it means
to “do the task” well or badly.

SCIENTIFIC METHOD:

You are trying to identify a model that adequately predicts the world by formulating
hypotheses and conducting a series of validation experiments to decide how to move forward.

A Classic Machine Learning Problem: Classifying Images
======================================================

Our Challenge: Build a Digit Recognizer
=======================================

We have a dataset of 50,000 images.
Each image is a single digit, written down by a human,
and scanned in 28 x 28 pixels resolution, encoded in grayscale,
with each pixel taking one of 256 possible shades of gray,
from full white to full black.

For each scan, we also know the correct answer,
that is, what number the human wrote down.

This dataset is known as the TRAINING SET.

This is known as a CLASSIFICATION problem:
Our goal is to separate images between known "categories" (0 - 9).

======================================
Distance Functions in Machine Learning
======================================

Two images that are absolutely identical have a distance of zero,
and the more the pixels differ, the larger the distance will be.

Our similarity measure has limitations.
If you took one image and simply cloned it,
but shifted it (for instance) by one pixel to the left,
their distance pixel-by-pixel might end up being quite large,
even though the images are essentially the same.

Distance functions also often appear in ML under another name: COST FUNCTIONS.

If we are trying to predict a number,
our prediction error—that is, how far our prediction is from the actual number—
is a DISTANCE.
