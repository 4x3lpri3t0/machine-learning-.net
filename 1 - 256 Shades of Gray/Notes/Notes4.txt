====================
Improving Your Model
====================

If your model is not good enough, you would start thinking about ways to improve predictions,
create new models, and run them against the validation set, comparing the percentage correctly
classified so as to evaluate whether your new models work any better, progressively refining
your model until you are satisfied with it.

F# is a wonderful .NET language, and is uniquely suited for machine learning and data science;
it will make our work experimenting with models much easier.

So, now that we have a working C# version, let’s dive in and rewrite it in F#
so that we can compare and contrast the two and better understand the F# way.

===================================
Introducing F# for Machine Learning
===================================

In order to see the quality of a model, after any code change,
we needed to rebuild the console app and run it, reload the data, and compute.

=======================================================
Live Scripting and Data Exploration with F# Interactive
=======================================================

F# Interactive is a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), basically a live-scripting environment
where you can play with code without having to go through the whole cycle described before.

(add "FSharp" library project)

F# and C# are completely interoperable and can talk to each other without problems.
Use C# for what C# is great at, and leverage the F# goodness for where F# shines!

script.fsx -> are not part of the build.
They can be used outside of Visual Studio as pure, free-standing scripts.

.fsx files constitute a wonderful “scratch pad” where you can experiment with code,
with all the benefits of IntelliSense.

While scripts are not part of the solution build, they are part of the solution itself,
and can (should) be versioned as well, so that you are always in a position to replicate
whatever experiment you were conducting in a script.

============================
Creating our First F# Script
============================

(see Script.fsx)

To run -> 
	1º : Select the code
	2º : right click, and pick “Run in Interactive” (or ALT + ENTER)
