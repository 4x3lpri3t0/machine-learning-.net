Naïvely Combining Scores
========================

We've decided to decompose our message into 3 tokens —“driving” “cant” “txt”—
	-> We still need to figure out a way to compute the probability
		-> that the message is Ham or Spam

(5_bayes_with_tokens.png)

We can simplify that.
Let’s assume that tokens are independent — that is, seeing one token in a
message has no bearing on what other tokens might be present.
In that case, we can compute:

P(SMS contains driving&cant&txt | SMS is Spam)
	= P(SMS contains "driving" | SMS is Spam)
	x P(SMS contains "cant" | SMS is Spam)
	x P(SMS contains "txt" | SMS is Spam)

With a bit of Bayes’ Theorem Jiu-Jitsu applied on the formula above, you should end up with the following:

P(SMS is Spam | SMS contains "driving,cant,txt")
	= P(SMS contains "driving" | SMS is Spam)
	x P(SMS contains "cant" | SMS is Spam)
	x P(SMS contains "txt" | SMS is Spam)
	x             P(SMS is Spam)
	  --------------------------------------
		P(SMS contains "driving,cant,txt")
