Simplified Document Score
=========================

At this point we are almost ready to dive into code and implement the classifier.

We can easily extract:
* P(SMS is Spam), the proportion of Spam messages in the training set
* P(SMS contains "X" | SMS is Spam), the proportion of Spam messages that contain the token “X”

* What we are interested in is deciding whether a message is Spam or Ham
* Drop the common term, spare ourselves some unnecessary computations
	-> simply compute a “score” instead of a probability:

	Score(SMS is Spam | SMS contains driving & cant & text) = 
		  P(SMS contains driving | SMS is Spam)
		x P(SMS contains cant | SMS is Spam)
		x P(SMS contains txt | SMS is Spam)
		x P(SMS is Spam)

* If Score(Spam) > Score(Ham), we will classify the message as Spam
